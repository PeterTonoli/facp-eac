<biogHist>
<abstract>Quadroon was a term used in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to describe a person of Aboriginal descent. It was given legal effect in the <span style="font-style:italic">Aborigines Act 1905</span> (s.2). A person described as a quadroon was also known as a quarter-caste. The term was important as it was used by authorities to define whether a person, including a child, was subject to laws created to 'protect' and control Aboriginal people in Western Australia. In the values of the time, the amount of white blood in a child's veins increased the likelihood that children would be separated from their Aboriginal families. The <span style="font-style:italic">Native Welfare Act Amendment Act 1960</span> (s.2b) removed quadroon from the definition of native.</abstract>
<p>A person described as a quadroon was someone who was deemed to be descended in part from Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal forebears - literally one part Aboriginal blood to three parts non-Aboriginal blood. The <span style="font-style:italic">Aborigines Act 1905</span> enabled the exemption of people who were classified as quadroons from some provisions of the Act but included them with those people classified as half-castes for other purposes. The <span style="font-style:italic">Bringing Them Home</span> report (p.90) shows that in Western Australia a person's degree of Aboriginality was important to authorities who were keen to prohibit mixed marriages and miscegenation (breeding among people from different races). The prohibitions arose because the authorities, who were mostly British settlers, self-identified as superior to the native people living within the boundaries of Western Australia. One of the key areas in which authorities exerted this superiority was through their views on where children of mixed Aboriginal descent should grow up.</p>
<p>When the Act was being debated in parliament, the term quadroon was removed from the definition of Aboriginal (s.3). <span style="font-style:italic">The West Australian</span> (16 December1905, p.12) reported this was because parliament felt that 'it was undesirable to classify as aborigines people who were quarter-caste or merely had aboriginal blood in their veins'.</p>
<p>In response to this, the Manager of the Native and Half-Caste Mission at Middle Swan wrote to the Editor of <span style="font-style:italic">The West Australian</span> (20 December 1905, p.3) and his letter is an example of how authorities justified the removal of Aboriginal children from their families:</p>
<p>'The child of a half-caste woman by a white man is probably as common a member of the community as the simple half-caste, and as time goes on the quarter-caste or quadroon will tend more and more to become the rule and the offspring of a pure-blood native the exception…the atmosphere of the native camp is the main determining factor in the make-up of a child's character, and not the exact amount of native blood in its veins.'</p>
<p>Therefore, according to Rev. Burton, the legislation should make 'due provision…whereby exemption is extended to quadroons born and reared in civilisation, but not to those whose surroundings, habits and instincts are exactly on the level of the full-blooded native.'</p>
<p>The issue that concerned Burton was that a child classified as quadroon might not be deemed as Aboriginal and thus not come under the guardianship of the Chief Protector and be unable to be removed and placed in an institution without parental consent.</p>
<p>Nearly thirty years later, the Commissioner for Native Affairs (Annual Report 1944, p.12) observed that the Children's Cottage Home, Queen's Park (Sister Kate's) 'undertakes the care of quadroon children, and rears them according to white standards'.</p>
<p>Quadroon also appears to have been used as a surname, possibly as a descriptor. The <span style="font-style:italic">Sunday Times</span> (5 March 1911) reported on the death of a two-year old child named George Quadroon at the Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>In the <span style="font-style:italic">Aborigines Act Amendment Act 1936</span> (s.2f), the term, quadroon was defined as 'a person who is descended from the full blood original inhabitants of Australia or their full blood descendents but who is only one-forth of the original full blood'. The legal use of quadroon as a degree of Aboriginality remained in force in Western Australia until the <span style="font-style:italic">Native Welfare Act Amendment Act 1960</span> (s.2b) removed quadroon from the definition of native.</p>
