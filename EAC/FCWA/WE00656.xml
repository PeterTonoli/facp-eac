<biogHist>
<abstract>The Adoption of Children Act Amendment Act 1964 (Act no. 100 of 1964 (13 Eliz. II No. 100)) was passed on 23 December 1964 and commenced on 1 May 1970. Its long title is 'An Act to Amend the Adoption of Children Act 1896-1962'. It made a number of changes to 'modernise' the 1896 Act, and bring it more into line with adoption legislation in other States.

This Act and its new Rules did not come into operation until 1 May 1970, more than five years after it had been passed by the Parliament. A key amendment to the Rules included changes to the application form so that adopting parents could not see the names of the parent(s) who had registered the child's birth. In practice, this information had been 'covered up' by Departmental social workers but the new form removed the identifying information completely.</abstract>
<p>In effect, the Adoption of Children Act Amendment Act 1964:</p>
<list><item>Ensured that the Child Welfare Department must approve of the adoptive parents before an adoption order could be granted</item>
<item>Recognised the mother of an illegimate child should have sole consent to the adoption, and not the putative father</item>
<item>Limited the period for revoking consent to 30 days, so as to decrease the uncertainty for adopting parents</item>
<item>Made medical (physical and mental health) checks compulsory for all children being considered for adoption</item>
<item> Allowed the Child Welfare Department to initiate adoption proceedings for children who had been placed in an institution for more than one year and whose parents had 'shown no interest' in their welfare. </item></list>
<p>The Adoption of Children Act Amendment Act 1964 widened the definition of 'parent' to include 'every person who is a parent or guardian of the child' where the child was legitimate (born to married parents). The consent of a mother alone was sufficient if the child was illegitimate. The method of 'revoking' (withdrawing) consent was clarified and the concept of 'defective consent' was introduced. In theory, this allowed the judge to determine if the consent for adoption had been given freely and in full knowledge of the consequences, or if:</p>
<list><item>consent had been obtained through 'fraud or duress'</item>
<item>the person giving consent was not 'in a fit condition' to do so</item>
<item>the person giving consent 'did not understand the nature of the consent'</item>
<item> a mother had signed the consent form before the birth of her child </item></list>
<p>Additionally, a Judge could not make an oder of adoption if the consent had been signed within seven days of the birth unless a doctor or registered midwife attested to the fitness of the mother to consent at that time. The WA Parliament acknowleged in 2010 that women were being urged to give up their babies for adoption during this era, so it is likely that certificates of 'fitness' were routinely given.</p>
<p>The amendments also updated occasions where a Judge could make an order without obtaining consent to include time when the parent(s) or guardian(s) :</p>
<list><item>after 'reasonable inquiry' could not be found</item>
<item>were not physically or mentally 'capable' of giving consent</item>
<item>had 'abandoned, deserted or persistently neglected or ill-treated' the child</item>
<item> had failed for a period of not less than one year and without good reason, to fulfill their parental obligations towards the child</item></list>
<p>Finally, the Judge retained the discretion to not require consent if there were 'any other special circumstances'.</p>
<p>The Director of Child Welfare became the guardian of any child who was awaiting an adoption order to be granted.</p>
<p>The 1964 amendments also recognised 'foreign adoptions' (adoptions that had been granted in countries outside the Commonwealth).</p>
<p>The amendments also expressly made it illegal to require or receive payments for adoptions, including charging a fee to arrange an adoption, with the exception of legal and medical fees.</p>
<p>Advertising a child for adoption or placing an advertisement seeking a child to adopt were also made illegal, except for those advertisements that were approved by the Director of Child Welfare, and it was illegal to publish identifying information about adoption cases.</p>
<p>Any child for whom an adoption order was sought had to have a certificate of physical and mental health signed by a doctor approved by the Child Welfare Department.</p>
