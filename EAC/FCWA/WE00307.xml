<p>Funding for this service has been provided through the Youth Supported Accommodation Program, which was a sub-program of the Commonwealth/State funded Supported Accommodation Assistance Programme (SAAP). [For notes on this program see the section on SAAP at the beginning of Signposts].</p>
<p>The service operated in 1989 in the Leederville / Subiaco area. In 1994, PICYS was described as providing youth accommodation services to 16-25 year olds. In 1995, PICYS's Funding Agreement with the Department outlined the purpose of the funded services, the service objectives and performance indicators:</p>
<p>The purpose of PICYS was to "provide medium to long term support and accommodation to young men and women who are homeless and in crisis in order to assist them to move to independent living."</p>
<p>Service Objectives:</p>
<p>"Young people have interpersonal skills to develop and sustain personal and where appropriate family networks.</p>
<p>Young people are able to participate more widely in the community and access social, educational and employment options.</p>
<p>Young people in need are provided with stable supported accommodation.</p>
<p>Young people move on to longer term stable non-SAAP accommodation."</p>
<p>(Funding Agreement between PICYS and Family and Children's Services 1995, as reported in the Out of Home, Preventative and Alternative Care Services Review, "Terms of Reference", Family and Children's Services, 1995).</p>
<p>In 2001 the Perth Inner City Youth Service was located in West Leederville and provided supported accommodation services to young people (including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders). The service had the capacity to provide medium to long term accommodation for up to 8 young people. (Service Agreement with the Department for Community Development).</p>
