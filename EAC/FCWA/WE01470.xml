<biogHist>
<abstract>Wandalgu Hostel was the new name given to the Pallottine Mission, Tardun around 1968. It was run by the Pallottines (Society of the Catholic Apostolates). Until 1968, girls and boys had lived in dormitories but these were converted and new cottages were built from that time. Wandalgu Hostel closed in 2004.</abstract>
<p>Wandalgu Hostel was the new name given to the Pallottine Mission, Tardun around 1968. Until 1968 there were around 100 children living at the mission. From this time series of 'houses' were built for different groups (for example, the Ag School Boys' House, with its own dining room and workshops; Little Girls' House; and Little Boys' House). In that year, 15 children went from the mission to the Morawa Junior High School.</p>
<p>When it was surveyed by Wilson and Robinson in 1971, (<span style="font-style:italic">Signposts</span> 2004, p.409) there were 79 primary school children, eight high school children and 20 agricultural school students living at Wandalgu. Some of the children were transferred to the Pallottine Centre at Riverton for further education. Reports from child welfare authorities in 1979 indicate that children were referred to Wandalgu until it closed. These may be the children referred to in the State Solicitor's Office in Western Australia (<span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Institutions Attended by Aboriginal People in Western Australia</span> 2005, p.132) which says that children who were deemed to be 'neglected' or 'deprived' were also admitted to the mission, along with children who were boarding students.</p>
<p>By 1978, the mission had a swimming pool, church and recreation hall. In 1982, the Senior Girls' House was extended to include single bedrooms, new toilets and showers, a lounge room and small kitchen. The Ag School Boys' House was converted to accommodate High School boys. In 1984, the Junior High School Girls' House was also renovated, with a large bedroom being converted into smaller rooms and a small kitchen installed. In 1984, an Aboriginal Parents' Council was appointed and Aboriginal staff were sought. School instruction was given in Wajarri language. In 1997, the school was connected to the internet.</p>
<p>In December 2004, Wandalgu closed.</p>
