<biogHist>
<abstract>Richard S. Haynes &amp; Co was a firm of lawyers in Western Australia who were involved in many adoptions from the 1940s to around 1980. One of the lawyers was Mr Richard Bryant and this series of records includes many of Mr Bryant's client files.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Access to these records is restricted and confidentiality is protected by the CPFS's Protocols for Access. If you believe the Department may hold records about you, or about a family member, you are encouraged to apply. CPFS has an application form which you must use to apply for records:
<list><item>Application for Past Adoption Services</item></list>
Please scroll down to 'Publications - Online Resources' to download an application form, or speak with someone in the Past Adoptions office.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>Any records about adoption are protected by the requirements of the Adoption Act 1994 (WA) and are released via Child Protection and Family Support. So, when Mr Bryant was no longer practising, RS Haynes &amp; Co decided it would be best to give the Department some records that still existed in Mr Bryant's files.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these records are not a complete set of the adoptions arranged through RS Haynes &amp; Co. However, the records that do exist are of a very high quality. Often they will not make happy reading, but Mr Bryant was very careful to record all the information he was able to gain about the parties to the adoption. Many of the adoptions which Mr Bryant was involved with were 'privately arranged', particularly from Catholic hospitals such as St John of God Subiaco and St Anne's Mt Lawley (which was run by the Sisters of Mercy and is now part of MercyCare).</p>
