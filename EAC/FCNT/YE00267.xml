<biogHist>
<abstract>Chinnery Family Home was opened by the government in Stuart Park in 1968. It provided long term accommodation for up to nine Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from babies to teenagers under the supervision of cottage parents. The exact closing date for the Chinnery Family Home is unknown.</abstract>
<p>Chinnery Family Home was opened in Henry Street, Stuart Park in 1968. It was one of three Family Homes opened by the Welfare Branch of the Northern Territory in the suburbs of Darwin that year. The other two Homes were the Harney Family Home and the Hamilton Family Home.</p>
<p>Chinnery Family Home, named after a former Director of Native Affairs, Mr EP Chinnery, was located in Stuart Park on land handed over to the Government by the Methodist Overseas Mission. A purpose built five bedroom family residence was constructed on the site.</p>
<p>The Chinnery Family Home provided accommodation for up to nine Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children, from babies to teenagers. Children remained in the Home for various periods of time, often long term. The Home had the capacity to take in a number of children from a single family.<br />
The Home was managed by a Cottage Mother and her husband. They received rent-free accommodation and were paid a subsidy for each child under their care as well as a supervisory allowance.</p>
<p>From 1972, the Chinnery Family Home was run by the Welfare Division which had replaced the Welfare Branch. From the end of 1972 until 1974 the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs took over control of child welfare in the Northern Territory and was therefore responsible for all government Homes for children. From 1974 the Home came under the control of the Community Welfare Section of the Northern Territory Administration. Statistical records from 1974 show that the Chinnery Family Home continued to take in children of all ages.</p>
<p>Although the Home was damaged by Cyclone Tracy in December 1974, the building was considered to be structurally sound and able to be repaired. It continued to operate through the late 1970s. The closing date of Chinnery Family Home is yet to be determined.</p>
