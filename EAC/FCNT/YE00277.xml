<biogHist>
<abstract>The Tennant Creek Family Home was opened by the government at Tennant Creek in 1973. It provided short and long term accommodation for a small number of children, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. Children lived in a family-style setting under the supervision of cottage parents. The exact closing date for the Tennant Creek Family Home is unknown.</abstract>
<p>The Tennant Creek Family Home opened in Staunton Street, Tennant Creek in 1973. It was one of a number of Family Homes which opened in regional areas of the Northern Territory in the period 1973-1974.</p>
<p>The Welfare Division made initial plans for opening a Family Home in Tennant Creek during the early 1970s. When the Home opened, it was initially run by the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs which had taken over control of child welfare in the Northern Territory in 1972. From 1974 the Tennant Creek Family Home was run by the Community Welfare Section of the Northern Territory Administration.</p>
<p>The Tennant Creek Family Home was a purpose-built cement brick residence which provided family-style accommodation for a small group of children.</p>
<p>The Home was managed by a Cottage Mother and her husband. Cottage Parents were provided with rent-free accommodation and were paid a subsidy for each child under their care as well as a supervisory allowance.</p>
<p>The Tennant Creek Family Home took in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from babies to teenagers for various periods of time, often long term. The Home had the capacity to take in a number of children from a single family.</p>
<p>The closing date of the Tennant Creek Family Home is yet to be determined.</p>
