<h4>Records</h4>
<p>The Forgotten Australians and Former Child Migrants Oral History Project is a collection of interviews with Forgotten Australians and Former Child Migrants recorded between 2009 and 2012. The project was funded by the Commonwealth Government as a result of recommendations made after two Senate Inquiries and the 2009 Apology to Forgotten Australians and Former Child Migrants. The Collection consists of more than 200 interviews with people from many different backgrounds and experiences. They include interviews with people who were in care as well as with other associated with child welfare, such as welfare officers and institutional staff. The interviews record the impact of experiences of being in care in Australia from the 1920s onwards and relate to over 140 different institutions, across Australia, run by state governments, church bodies and non-government organizations. They also include interviews with people who lived in foster care as children.</p>
