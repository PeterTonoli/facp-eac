<biogHist>
<abstract>The Pine Creek Home, which had operated from 1931 to 1932, was reopened by the government in 1940 as a place for Aboriginal children who were being transferred from government institutions to various Missions. In late 1940, 70 children were in residence in the Home. Pine Creek Home only operated for a matter of months and closed in 1941. Records suggest that the Pine Creek Home may also have been used during 1942 as temporary accommodation for people being evacuated from the Northern Territory during World War II.</abstract>
<p>In 1939 the new Native Affairs Branch, on a recommendation from the then Chief Medical Officer and Protector of Aborigines, Dr Cecil Cook, began negotiations with various religious organisations to have each denomination take charge of their own so called 'half-caste' children. When the agreement was reached many children from The Bungalow and Myilly Point Home were moved out to the Missions.</p>
<p>The Pine Creek Home at Pine Creek, approximately 200km south east of Darwin, had originally operated between 1931 and 1933 to accommodate children from the over-crowded Myilly Point Home for Aboriginal children who were considered at that time to be 'half-caste'. In 1940 the government reopened the Home to accommodate the Aboriginal children who were on their way from the government institutions to the various Missions. According to newspaper reports there were 70 children in residence at the Home when it was damaged by a cyclone in November 1940.</p>
<p>The Pine Creek Home only operated for a matter of months and closed in 1941. Records, however, suggest that the Pine Creek Home may also have been used during 1942 as temporary accommodation for people being evacuated from the Northern Territory during World War II.</p>

Pine Creek Repeater Station. History:
The building was first erected at Burrundie in 1888-89, to serve as quarters for the Northern Territory's Chief Mining Warden. It was one of the earliest (possibly the first) prefabricated iron structures built for official purposes in the Territory. At Burrundie the building also served as an office and court house in the 1890s. Following the relocation of government functions away from Burrundie from the turn of the century, the building was dismantled and then re-erected in Pine Creek where from 1913 it served as quarters for the Pine Creek Mining Warden. The Niemann family lived in and operated a pharmacy from the building in the 1920s, and a government clinic also operated from the building. Between 1931 and 1933 the building was used as part of the Pine Creek Half Caste Home. From 1934 the building served as a clinic and hospital. In 1942 the building was requisitioned by the military authorities and was used as an exchange on the Adelaide-Darwin telephone link during World War Two. A military post office was also established in the structure. After the war the site was used by the PCG for telephone exchange and residence purposes. The building is currently used as a museum and it also fulfills community functions.</abstract>
