<biogHist>
<abstract>St Mary's Child and Family Welfare Service was established as a local Central Australian based welfare agency of the Anglican Church in 1972. The name was later shortened to St Mary's Family Services. This organisation ran St Mary's Children's Village and three other town based cottages in Alice Springs. In the 1980s the organisation became Anglicare Central Australia. In 2002 it amalgamated with the Darwin based service, Anglicare Top-End, and the new entity became known as Anglicare NT.</abstract>
