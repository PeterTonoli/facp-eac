<biogHist>
<abstract>Leslie Cottage, St Mary's opened in Alice Springs in 1973 as one of three town based family group homes. The others were Heath Cottage and Matthews Cottage. Run by St Mary's Child and Family Welfare Service who also ran St Mary's Children's Village, Leslie Cottage provided cottage accommodation for between 8 and 10 children under the supervision of cottage parents. In 1982 Leslie Cottage provided residential accommodation for children with disabilities. Records suggest that Leslie Cottage closed in the 1980s.</abstract>
<p>Leslie Cottage, St Mary's was opened in 1973 by the Anglican organisation, St Mary's Child and Family Welfare Service, which also ran the St Mary's Children's Village. It was named after Anglican Bishop Ken Leslie, who had been the Anglican Parish priest in Alice Springs after World War II.</p>
<p>Located in Standley Crescent, Alice Springs, Leslie Cottage was one of three town based cottages. The others were Heath Cottage and Matthews Cottage. The three cottages at the St Mary's Children's Village and the three town cottages were together often referred to as St Mary's. Leslie Cottage was named after Anglican Bishop Ken Leslie, who had been the Anglican Parish priest in Alice Springs after World War II.</p>
<p>Each town cottage provided family style accommodation for between eight and ten children. The children were supervised by a cottage parent or parents who were assisted by a relief cottage parent when required. The Cottage took in children who were wards of the State and siblings were often placed together. Most attended the Traeger Park Primary School and Alice Springs High School.</p>
<p>From 1982 Leslie Cottage was used as accommodation for children with disabilities. Research suggest that Leslie Cottage closed during the 1980s.</p>
