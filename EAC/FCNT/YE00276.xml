<biogHist>
<abstract>Ryan House was opened by the government in Katherine in 1974. It operated as a Family Home and provided short and long term accommodation for a small number of children, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. Children lived in a family-style setting under the supervision of cottage parents. The exact closing date for Ryan House is unknown.</abstract>
<p>Ryan House was one of two Family Homes which opened in Katherine in the period 1973-1974. The other Home was the Cameron Crescent Family Home. Ryan House was located on Lockheed Street and was a purpose-built cement brick residence. It provided mainly long term accommodation for a small group of children in a family-style setting.</p>
<p>When the initial Family Home in Katherine was proposed in 1968, the Welfare Branch stated that over the past year there had been five State children and eight other children in urgent need of accommodation, all of whom could have been placed in a Family Home.</p>
<p>Ryan House was managed by a Cottage Mother and her husband. Cottage Parents were provided with rent-free accommodation and were paid a subsidy for each child under their care as well as a supervisory allowance.</p>
<p>Ryan House took in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from babies to teenagers for various periods of time, often long term. The Home had the capacity to take in a number of children from a single family.</p>
<p>The closing date for Ryan House is yet to be determined.</p>
