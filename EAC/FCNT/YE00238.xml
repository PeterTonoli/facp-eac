<biogHist>
<abstract>Luxton Street Cottage opened in Stuart Park in 1971. Run by Somerville Homes Incorporated it was one of six cottages which made up Somerville Cottage Homes. It accommodated up to eight children aged between 4 and 16 years under the supervision of cottage parents. The Cottage Home closed in 1981.</abstract>
<p>Luxton Street Cottage opened in 1971 in the Darwin suburb of Rapid Creek. It was one of the first of six family group homes known as Somerville Cottage Homes. The Homes were run by Somerville Homes Incorporated, an association established by the United Church in Northern Australian and the Methodist Overseas Mission. The other Somerville Cottage Homes were located in Chapman Road, Trower Road Clarke Crescent and Fox Crescent in Rapid Creek and Henry Street in Stuart Park.</p>
<p>Luxton Street Cottage provided care for up to eight children, both Aboriginal and non Aboriginal, aged between 4 and 16 years under the supervision of cottage parents. A statistical summary dated 30 June 1971 shows that on that day the cottage was accommodating two girls aged 7 and 9 and four boys aged 5 to 12.</p>
<p>In an early pamphlet, Luxton Street cottage was also referred to as Delaraine Cottage, carrying on the name of one of the cottages on Croker Island, from where many of the first groups of children in Somerville Cottage Homes came. This name appears to have been used rarely as all of the Cottages were generally referred to by their street addresses.</p>
<p>Luxton Street Cottage was damaged by Cyclone Tracy in December 1974 and therefore closed as a cottage for children. No children were present at the time of the cyclone as all were on holiday placements interstate. The building was repaired and in 1975-1976 was used as a staff residence. It appears to have reopened again as a family group home and then closed in 1981.</p>
