<abstract>The Pine Creek Home was established by the government at Pine Creek in 1931 to alleviate over-crowding at the Myilly Point Home in Darwin. The first children were moved there in September 1931. Pine Creek Home operated for two years and closed in 1933 and the children were transferred to The Bungalow in Alice Springs and back to the Myilly Point Home in Darwin.</abstract>
<p>The Pine Creek Home was established by the government at Pine Creek, approximately 200km south east of Darwin, in 1931. It was opened to alleviate over-crowding at the Myilly Point Home near Kahlin Compound, which was also known at the time as the 'Darwin Half-caste Home '. Initially in September 1931 28 boys between four and 14 years of age were removed from Myilly Point and transferred to Pine Creek. The Pine Creek Home closed in 1933, with most of the children being transferred to The Bungalow in Alice Springs and back to the Myilly Point Home in Darwin.</p>

Pine Creek Repeater Station. History:
The building was first erected at Burrundie in 1888-89, to serve as quarters for the Northern Territory's Chief Mining Warden. It was one of the earliest (possibly the first) prefabricated iron structures built for official purposes in the Territory. At Burrundie the building also served as an office and court house in the 1890s. Following the relocation of government functions away from Burrundie from the turn of the century, the building was dismantled and then re-erected in Pine Creek where from 1913 it served as quarters for the Pine Creek Mining Warden. The Niemann family lived in and operated a pharmacy from the building in the 1920s, and a government clinic also operated from the building. Between 1931 and 1933 the building was used as part of the Pine Creek Half Caste Home. From 1934 the building served as a clinic and hospital. In 1942 the building was requisitioned by the military authorities and was used as an exchange on the Adelaide-Darwin telephone link during World War Two. A military post office was also established in the structure. After the war the site was used by the PCG for telephone exchange and residence purposes. The building is currently used as a museum and it also fulfills community functions.</abstract>
