<biogHist>
<abstract>The Cameron Crescent Family Home was opened by the government in Katherine in 1973. It provided short and long term accommodation for a small number of children, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. Children lived in a family-style setting under the supervision of cottage parents. The exact closing date for the Cameron Crescent Family Home is unknown.</abstract>
<p>In 1968, when the idea of opening a Family Home in Katherine was first proposed, the Welfare Branch of the Northern Territory Administration stated that over the past year there had been five State children and eight other children in urgent need of accommodation, all of whom could have been placed in a Family Home.</p>
<p>Plans were made by the successor of the Welfare Branch, the Welfare Division, for opening a Family Home in Katherine during the early 1970s. The Cameron Crescent Family Home was one of two Family Homes which opened in Katherine in the period 1973-1974. The other Home was known as Ryan House. When the Cameron Crescent Family Home opened in 1973, it was initially run by the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs which took over control of child welfare in the Northern Territory from 1972 until 1974. From 1974 the Home came under the control of the Community Welfare Section of the Northern Territory Administration.</p>
<p>The Cameron Crescent Home and was a purpose-built cement brick residence which provided mainly long term accommodation for a small group of children in a family-style setting.</p>
<p>The Cameron Crescent Family Home was managed by a Cottage Mother and her husband. Cottage Parents were provided with rent-free accommodation and were paid a subsidy for each child under their care as well as a supervisory allowance.</p>
<p>The Cameron Crescent Home took in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from babies to teenagers for various periods of time, often long term. The Home had the capacity to take in a number of children from a single family.</p>
<p>The closing date of the Cameron Crescent Family Home is yet to be determined.</p>
