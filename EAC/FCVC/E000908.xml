<biogHist>
<abstract>Orana Images Collection is an extensive collection of records, comprising the photographic collection of the Methodist Homes for Children and its successor agencies Orana - the Peace Memorial Homes for Children, the Methodist Department of Child Care, Orana Family Services and UnitingCare Orana. This photographic collection now resides with Lentara UnitingCare.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>The Heritage Coordinator, Uniting Heritage Service welcomes requests from care leavers who may want to access the collection. Please note that some photos in the collection may be personal and subject to standard privacy protection. For further information or to access the collection the Heritage Coordinator, Uniting Heritage Service.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>Orana Family Services (1988-2011, now known as Lentara UnitingCare, a community service agency of the Uniting Church in Australia) was founded in 1888 as part of the Wesleyan Church, Central Dorcas Association Help and Rescue Society. Orana and its predecessor agencies have provided essential out-of-home care services to Victorian children who for various reasons could not live with their own families. The organisation ceased providing out-of-home care services in 2012 after 124 years of continuous service. The photographic collection now resides with Lentara UnitingCare.</p>
<p>The photographic collection consists of black and white photos, colour photos, slides and negatives. The content date range of the collection is 1888-c2010 - the earliest photos being reproductions of photos from the Orana Annual Reports (1886-2012). There are approximately 20,000 items in the photographic collection and the collection has largely been imaged, described, housed and stored to archival standard. Some elements of data analysis and identification of photographs is continuing.</p>
<p>The photographic collection is in very good condition for its age and is fully accessible as all images, along with relevant information (metadata) have been stored in the fully searchable electronic photographic library, Adobe Lightroom 4. A broad subject based index (paper), developed in 1988 during Orana's centenary year, was discovered with the photographic collection during the cataloguing process and has been used to assist in developing a batching and subject naming protocol for photographs that clearly relate to the 1988 index.</p>
<p>Photos in the collection that may be of particular interest to care leavers of the Orana Homes include the following subjects: Cheltenham home; Cato farm; Orana Burwood; all the Burwood cottages by cottage name; Coolaroo; Gwenalan; Meadow Heights; Chapel; TC Rentoul Hall; children, by name; children's activities, by activity; Orana Fair; Orana Birthday and buildings and grounds.</p>
<p>Lentara UnitingCare gratefully acknowledges the financial contribution of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs which assisted in the cataloguing of the first 4,200 items of the collection.</p>
