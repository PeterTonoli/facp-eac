<p>Goulburn Valley Family Care was established n 1984 to provide non-government, non-profit services to families throughout the Goulburn Valley region. It was a program of the Child and Family Care Network, formerly the Burwood Children's Home.</p>
<p> In the late 1970s the Home had began to redirect its operations to the Shepparton region. Initially, two group homes were set up for the care of country children in a country setting.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Goulburn Valley Family Care provided a small family support service centering on household management and the care of children at home. Services have been extended to support families across all age groups. Carer support information and services to support those who care for the aged or disabled people and enable them to stay in their own home is now a core service. Young people with a disability and their families are also supported through a Host program. An additional range of services to support children and families are provided including mental health programs, counselling services, as well as building parenting, communication and relationship skills.</p>
<p>Goulburn Valley Family Care was incorporated in 1994. In the late 1990s, with financial support from the Seymour Shire Goulburn, Goulburn Valley Family Care became the major provider of family services for the West Hume region including the Local Government Areas of Moira, Greater Shepparton, Strathbogie, Mitchell and Murrindindi.</p>
<p> In 2006, the organisation was renamed FamilyCare although its legal name remains Goulburn Valley Family Care Inc. FamilyCare is administered by a Board of Directors. Services center around aged and disability support services, child and family support services and a range of community programs including families and relationship building.</p>
