<biogHist>
<abstract>Glastonbury Community Services Records date from 1854 to 2015 and relate to the operation of Glastonbury Community Services and its predecessor agencies. The records are held by Barwon Child, Youth &amp; Family. The collection includes the records of over 2,000 children that were in its care. The collection includes admission records, client files, matron and superintendent reports, videos and photographs.</abstract>
<h4> Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Conditional Access - Former residents of Glastonbury's out-of-home care programs and their families can contact Barwon Child, Youth &amp; Family to gain access to records and information about their time in 'care'.</p>
<p>Glastonbury Community Services, Archive search information for past clients, 2012, states:</p>
<p>'Glastonbury cannot guarantee to have information about all past clients. Record keeping in the past was often very scant and some past clients may only have an entry in the admissions books. Also we have anecdotal evidence that some client files were destroyed in the late 1960's.</p>
<p>If we do have records about you or a member of your family we will process your request as quickly as possible. However, under the Privacy Laws we can not release information about a third party unless the person gives their written permission or they are deceased. Therefore, we may need to take certain information out of your records before we give you a copy of your information.'</p>

<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>During a survey of records completed in 2009, it was found that Glastonbury's on site storage room contained closed (i.e. access is restricted) files. Closed files stayed on site for 3 years before being boxed and sent to an off-site storage facility run by 'Advance Records Management'. There were about 175 boxes (carton size) there. The meeting room at Glastonbury Child and Family Services contained photos, memorabilia and antique furniture. The on site storage room and the cupboards in meeting room two contained other boxed heritage material.</p>
<p>In the 1980s some of the records were transferred to the Geelong Heritage Centre. Glastonbury retains CD and DVD copies of the client files transferred to the Geelong Heritage Centre. The Geelong Heritage Centre has the original paper files, as well as copies of the CD and DVD.</p>
