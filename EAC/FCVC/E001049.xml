<biogHist>
<abstract>Wesley Mission Victoria holds minimal records from Tally Ho Training Farm prior to the 1980s and has, for some time, been actively searching for personal records and other documents to assist past residents seeking information about their time at Tally Ho.</abstract>
<h4>Fires at Tally Ho</h4>
<p>It had been thought that a fire or fires may have been the reason why the records are incomplete. In 2014, Wesley conducted an investigation to explore the evidence for this belief. The researcher examined the records from Tally Ho held by Wesley, in which various documents made reference to fires in 1958, 1964 and 1965.</p>
<p>The 1958 fire occurred in the drying room of one of eight cottages. The report's findings stated "There is insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion on whether records were lostâ€¦however any loss is presumed to be limited to records relating to the clients residing in the particular cottage at the time."</p>
<p>In relation to the 1964 and 1965 fires, the report found that "records were unlikely to have been lost" due to the locations of the fires and that records were not listed amongst items destroyed.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>Wesley deeply regrets it does not hold complete records from Tally Ho. At the time of writing, Wesley has around 5,000 archive boxes, which are thought to mainly contain administrative records from across the organisation. However the contents of every box are being carefully reviewed for personal records from Tally Ho.</p>
<p>Staff from the Uniting Heritage Service are in ongoing discussion with the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services about any Tally Ho records they may hold. Other avenues for locating records and information are being explored including the Victorian Department of Education and former staff.</p>
<p>Since April 2003, Wesley has maintained a register of requests for Tally Ho resident records. If records relating to anyone on this register are located, Wesley will make every effort to let them know that new information is available.</p>
<p>Wesley is interested in hearing from past residents, staff, holiday hosts and any others who may have photographs and other memorabilia items from Tally Ho, that may help provide background and context for the experiences of people who have left care.</p>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>If you spent time at Tally Ho and would like to request a search of Wesley's records for information relating to your past, please complete a records request and contact the Uniting Heritage Service.</p>
