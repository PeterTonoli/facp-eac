<biogHist>
<abstract>Alan and Ivy McWilliams speak about their childhood, including the period that Ivy spent in the Christian Brethren Children's Home, Wentworth Falls, New South Wales. After marrying in 1957, they were drawn to mission work by letters from Umeewarra Mission, South Australia. To their church asking for help. They arrived at Umeewarra Mission in 1959 and stayed until 1995. They describe the staff, living conditions and routines of the Mission, and how the children were placed there. They discuss the Mission's interactions with the Aborigines Protection Board and the Department of Native Welfare. They also speak about the changes that occurred when the government took over the Mission in 1964, including the transition to foster home arrangements.</abstract>
