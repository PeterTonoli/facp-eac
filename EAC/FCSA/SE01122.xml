<biogHist>
<abstract>This series contains registers created by McBride Maternity Hospital, formerly Adelaide Maternity Home, to record information about unmarried women entering the hospital for the birth of their child. The registers are in the form of bound volumes containing pre-printed pages with handwritten entries. The registers are indexed at the front by name. Entries are arranged chronologically by date of admittance to the hospital.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Although some early records relating to children in care in South Australia are open access, many later records are subject to restrictions, particularly records which contain personal information about individuals. Written permission must be obtained from the government agency which created the record in order to access restricted material. In the case of records relating to children, the current agency responsible is the Department for Communities and Social Inclusion (DCSI).</p>
<p>A Research Centre Members card, obtainable at the Archives, is required to research records held at State Records.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>Information recorded in the volumes includes name, date of admission, age, where born, occupation, details of any previous admission to prison or other social homes, address of parents or relatives, details regarding financial support while in the home, date left, where gone to, name of child, date of child's birth, name and address of father of child, details regarding the child's financial support, whether the child was born healthy and, if the child was adopted, the name and address of adopting parents. Not all information is recorded for each entry.</p>
<p>The first volume is titled 'Girls' Statement and After Career' and the pages are headed 'Girl's Statement on Admission' and 'Final Statement and After Career'. Subsequent volumes are either untitled, or titled 'Record Book', 'Social Homes Record Book' or 'Social Homes Records'. Earlier volumes also include admission numbers, this practice ceased during 1913.</p>
<p>The location of the volumes for 1899, 1910 to 1911 and 1923 to 1924 is not known. Records for the years 1893, 1898, 1909, 1912, 1922 and 1925 also appear to be incomplete.</p>
<p>Volume 2 (1900-1903) and volume 7 (1925-1928) cannot be issued until conserved.</p>
