<abstract>This series comprises a record of cases attended by the Women Police Branch. Cards are arranged by subject, with contacts listed chronologically on each card.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>A Research Centre Members card, obtainable at the Archives, is required to research records held at State Records.</p>
<p>Although some very early records relating to children in care in South Australia are open for access, most records relating to children are subject to a 100 year restriction, particularly those which contain personal information about individuals. Written permission must be obtained from the government agency which created the record in order to access restricted material. To obtain permission a Freedom of Information (FOI) request form must be submitted to the relevant government department. State Records staff will be able to assist you with this.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>The Women Police Branch dealt primarily with the moral and social welfare of women and children, with criminal offences being handled by the regular police force.</p>
<p>These card are arranged by subject and cross reference the set of case cards arranged by surname. Each card has a subject heading with the cases recorded chronologically, including name and personal details as well as details of contact with the Women Police Branch. The subject headings included are:</p>
<p>Student - Kildare College, Unknown Person, Artists and Nude Models, Purse Snatchers, Absconders from Glandore, Girls Warned, Alleged Brothels, Prostitutes etc, Girls &amp; Boys Absconded, Spoken to and/or Warned, Mental Patients - Absconded, Marriage Enquiries, Impersonate Police, Miscellaneous (including suspects, information re: anonymous persons) and Aged People who Wander.</p>
<p>This series ended in 1974 when women were integrated into the same chain of command as male police officers, and the welfare aspect of the job was undertaken by officers of the Department for Community Welfare.</p>
<p>For case cards arranged by surname see GRS4060.</p>
<p>Arranged by subject (not alphabetical). These records are closed for 75 years after the last date on card.</p>
