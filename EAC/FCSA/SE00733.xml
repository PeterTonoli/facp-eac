<abstract>The collection Records created by the State Children's Department comprises a number of archival series which were created by this department. The reference numbers for the series included in this collection all begin with the State Children's Department's Agency number, GRG 27. For example GRG27/1 is the Correspondence files of the State Children's Department.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>A Research Centre Members card, obtainable at the Archives, is required to research records held at State Records.</p>
<p>Although some very early records relating to children in care in South Australia are open for access, most records relating to children are subject to a 100 year restriction, particularly those which contain personal information about individuals. Written permission must be obtained from the government agency which created the record in order to access restricted material. To obtain permission a Freedom of Information (FOI) request form must be submitted to the relevant government department. State Records staff will be able to assist you with this.</p>
