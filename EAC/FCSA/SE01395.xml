<abstract>The Children's Court in South Australia was established in 1895 under the provisions of the State Children Act. This Act provided for all cases related to children to be held separately from adults. The Children's Court was replaced by the Youth Court in 1993 as a result of the passing of the Youth Court Act (SA) that year.</abstract>
<p>The Children's Court in South Australia was established in 1895 under the provisions of the State Children Act. Prior to 1890 cases involving children were heard in an open public court alongside adults. In 1890 the State Children's Council regarded this situation to be 'most undesirable' and began to work towards a solution. In its 1890 Annual Report, the Council stated its plan to hear all charges against girls under 18 and boys under 16 in a makeshift court in the offices of the department. This meant that when children were arrested they were detained under the care of the department while awaiting trial rather than being locked in a cell at the city watch house. The child's trial then took place in one of the offices which was set up as a court room. The report described the method as follows:</p>
<p>'At the hearing an inspector of this department conducts the cases, and another officer acts as clerk of the court. The children are thus kept entirely separate from the Police Station and Police Court.'</p>
<p>The court was presided over by the Police Magistrate or two justices of the peace.</p>
<p>In 1895 this arrangement became part of legislation. Although not referred to as a children's court at this time, the Act called for all hearings involving children to be held in a separate room. Within the metropolitan area cases were to be heard in a room approved by the Chief Secretary "and not in any police or other court house". In country areas cases were still permitted to be held in a court house, but had to be dealt with at a different time that other trials.</p>
<p>The Children's Court was replaced by the Youth Court in 1993 as a result of the passing of the Youth Court Act (SA) that year.</p>
