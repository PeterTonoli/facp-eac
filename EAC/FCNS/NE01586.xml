<biogHist>
<abstract>The<span style="font-style:italic">Inquiry into Health Services for the Psychiatrically Ill and Developmentally Disabled</span> was chaired by David T Richmond in 1983 and its findings are usually referred to as 'The Richmond Report'. It changed mental health and disability provision in New South Wales, and influenced other services, including out-of-home care for children. Richmond evaluated mental health services, psychiatric hospitals, institutional care for people with mental disabilities and group homes. He recommended the closure of 'fifth schedule' hospitals: that is, institutions for people with mental disabilities and psychiatric illnesses. This process, called 'deinstitutionalisation', was embraced by the NSW Government and meant people were moved from large institutions into community care, group homes and other residential facilities. Community services to support them were enhanced. The impact of this change on people with intellectual disability and psychiatric conditions and their carers and families is contested.</abstract>
