<biogHist>
<abstract>Ormond Regional Youth Centre was established at Westleigh (formerly part of Thornleigh) by the Department of Youth and Community Services in 1985. It used the same buildings in Duffy Avenue that had been used by the Ormond Training School and the Ormond School. The Centre provided assistance to children aged 9 to 15 years who had been sentenced by the Courts or who entered voluntarily. It, like Ormond School, was a School for Specific Purposes. Ormond Regional Youth Centre closed in 1998. The buildings were later demolished.</abstract>
<p>The Ormond Regional Youth Centre opened in the premises in 1985. The purpose of the Centre was to provide assistance to children aged nine to 15 years who had been sentenced by the Courts or who entered voluntarily. Most of the children had serious schooling problems. The average period in residence was 20 weeks. In a submission to the Senate Community Affairs Committee Inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, the mother of a boy sent to the facility at that time wrote:</p>
<p>'My son suffered great anguish while he was there, it was criminal that my son remained there for [nine months] at the age of 11 years ... My son was suicidal when he came home ... I would like my son's story exposed and for him to understand the number of kids who have gone through assaults and abuse by both the staff at Ormond and the so called 'normal kids', who were no way near the intellect level of my son ... Ormond was nothing more than a dumping ground for kids.'</p>
<p>In November 1997 the Minister for Community Services, then Ron Dyer, told the Parliament 'I took a decision for good and well understood reasons to close both the Ormond and Minali institutions.' According to <span style="font-style:italic">Hansard</span>:</p>
<p>'They will close at such time as there are no longer any children receiving services within them. Ormond and Minali are congregate care centres. They are being closed to provide smaller community-based or family setting accommodation for children who are in need of State care. Worldwide developments in substitute care support the move away from institutional settings for young people who, I would remind the House, have done nothing wrong - they have not offended against the criminal law - but are in need of State care. The redesign and relocation of Ormond and Minali are occurring in a staged manner with both institutions to be closed during 1998. However, current services will not close before new service arrangements are in place to better meet the individual needs of these young people.'</p>
<p>Ormond closed in 1998. Ormond Regional Youth Centre and Minali Receiving and Assessment Centre were the last residential care institutions operated by the Department of Community Services.</p>
<p>The buildings were demolished and have been replaced by housing.</p>
