<abstract>The Infants' Home, Ashfield, Records is a collection of records created by The Infants' Home between 1874 and 2002 and held by the State Library of New South Wales.This collection consists of registers and lists of resident children, children's admission and discharge information, child health records, family records files, historical and operational records and minutes.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>Former residents of The Infants' Home or members of their families can apply to The Infants' Home to be provided with copies of their records.

Application forms are available to download from the website.</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>The records are held in three separate manuscript collections at the State Library of New South Wales as the records were transferred at three different times - in 1975, 1995 and 2004.
