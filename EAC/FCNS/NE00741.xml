<biogHist>
<abstract>The United Protestant Association of NSW Ltd, at Wahroonga, hold a variety of records of the children's homes managed by the 12 district councils of the United Protestant Association of New South Wales (UPA). This includes admission and discharge books, holiday application records and photographs. UPA are committed to providing as much assistance as possible in tracing/locating any information for and on behalf of Care Leavers and Former Child Migrants. An electronic database is under development to promote access to the records held in the UPA Archives.</abstract>
<h4>Access Conditions</h4>
<p>If you wish to enquire about your time in a UPA Home or request copies of personal records, please write, telephone or email the United Protestant Association at Wahroonga. UPA will make records available to people who have been in their care, although records are often limited in content. UPA allow Care Leavers and Former Child Migrants to add to or amend their records. UPA does not charge for any research and assistance given or for copies/scans of records requested. Information will only be made available directly to the person concerned. UPA will provide support by way of a qualified counsellor with ongoing support available through Wattle Place (Relationships Australia).</p>
<h4>Records</h4>
<p>The UPA Archive holds records of children's homes managed by the 12 district councils of the United Protestant Association of New South Wales. Over 3,200 children passed through the UPA Homes.</p>
<p>The UPA collection includes records from UPA homes, including:</p>
<list><item><h4>Admission and Discharge books</h4>. The Department of Child Welfare required each institution/organisation/home to complete a Notification of Admission or Discharge upon admission or removal of any child from a home. The forms supplied the child's/children's names, dates when they were admitted/removed from a home, by whom, where they would be residing (another UPA home or private address) occupation of parents (if known) and in the case of Admission Registers, the agreed amount to be paid to UPA by the parent/parents.</item>
<item><h4>Matrons Reports</h4>. Matrons (House Mothers) were required to submit a Monthly Report to the District Manager. The monthly reports were dated, included the number of boys or girls in the home, and the name of each Home. The Matron was required to supply written details of children who received medical/dental or hospital treatment, children still receiving treatment, behavioural concerns etc. The report also requested updates on the condition of the interior/exterior of the home. Some entries also contain further information regarding the children in the home. Some Matrons/House Mothers were poorly educated and often reports were incomplete, blank or not submitted at all.</item>
<item><h4>Minutes of District Council meetings</h4>. These consist of bound volumes of minutes of the meetings of the 12 District Councils of UPA, dating back to the 1950s. Contained within these Council Minutes was information regarding UPA homes and the children who lived in them (with names supplied). Council minutes include information in relation to admissions, discharges, parents, relocating children, court appearances, health issues, Child Welfare Department issues and many other items relating to UPA homes and children.</item>
<item><h4>Slides, photographs</h4>. Includes a wide collection of images (colour, and black and white) relating to the UPA children's' homes which have been indexed on an electronic database.</item>
<item><h4>Holiday Application Records</h4>. All children who stayed in UPA Homes were billeted out during the holidays. In some cases children spent the holidays with their own families but in most instances children were sent out to other families, often as companionship to single child families. It was necessary for written applications to be received by the UPA when a request was made for a child to stay with a particular family. From this information a roster was completed with details of the child, the family concerned, address etc. In some cases the records also include comments recorded when the child returned to the UPA Home after the holidays, for instance about the child's experiences during the holidays. These records are often incomplete.</item>
<item>For some people, the UPA also have birth certificates, child welfare forms, court orders, social security forms, punishment books, visitor books, infant registers (under seven years old), correspondence to and from parents, school reports, sporting certificates, medical treatment books. However, sadly, some files contain only the barest of information.</item></list>
<p>The UPA Archive collection also includes:</p>
<list><item>Issues of <span style="font-style:italic">Protestant World Magazine</span>, published by the UPA from the early 1940s to the mid-1980s. The <span style="font-style:italic">Protestant World Magazine</span> included information about or relevant to the children in the care of the UPA. The information includes which homes children were in, dates when children left the UPA or were transferred to another home, achievements in sporting events, birthday messages to children in the homes, and letters from homes to the editor, 'Aunty Rose'. It includes short articles about careers, marriages, sickness of UPA children, death notices, etc, and also black and white images. The magazine was the voice of the UPA at that time, and its role included raising funds for the children's homes.</item></list>
<p>Since 2002, the United Protestant Association has been developing an electronic database of information about the children who have spent time in care at a UPA home. The information in the database is sourced from records held in the UPA Archives, including some of the records listed above. The database includes core information about each child, including name, date of birth, parents' names, admission and discharge dates; and a cross reference to the child's personal file. The database also includes images and photographs. This database is called 'UPA Connect'.</p>
